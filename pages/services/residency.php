        <h2>Requirements In Getting Barangay Clearance Or Certificate Of Residency</h2>
        <p>Also referred to as a certificate of residency, the barangay clearance is another important government-issued document that can be used in various transactions either with government offices or with private institutions. For instance, it's a common requirement when you apply for a business permit with the concerned government agency. Likewise, it can also serve as a valid ID when you are going to open an account in a bank. For example, EastWest Bank accepts the barangay clearance as a document in lieu of a proof of billing when you open a savings account. These are just a few of the important uses of the document.</p>
