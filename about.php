			<h2>Legal Basis of Barangay Existence</h2>
			<p>
				The Barangay came into existence on August 6, 1971, during the term of Mayor Luis Lardizabal. Through the guidance and assistance of the Association of Barrio Council, this was then headed by Mr. Federico Librado.
				Mr. Lawrence Baon was appointed as Barrio Captain to initially administer the affairs of the newly created Barrio pending the election of a regular Barrio Captain and its Barangay Council.
				The first election in the Barrio was held on January 9, 1972. The term Barrio was later changed by virtue of a law to Barangay which is still used today.

			<h2>History of Greenwater</h2>
			<p>
				The neighborhood association thought GREENWATER VILLAGE as its official name of the new born barrio because of the presence of spring water that seems to appear green in color because of the moss abounding it.
				Another reason is that the terms green and water go together: green plants help produce water while water makes plants look fresh and green.
